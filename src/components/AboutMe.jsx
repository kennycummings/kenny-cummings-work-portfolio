            I’m a front-end developer and AEM web content author who specializes in building
            scalable, user-friendly digital experiences. My work lives at the intersection of
            clean UI, maintainable code, and content that actually performs in production.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professionally, I’ve supported high-traffic e-commerce and content platforms by
            shipping pages quickly, improving SEO and navigation, and collaborating across
            design, marketing, and development teams. I’m comfortable working inside established
            design systems while still finding opportunities to improve performance and usability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of client and enterprise work, I build original projects like <strong>Awoken</strong>,
            a turn-based RPG where I handle gameplay systems, UI, and original music. These projects
            let me explore architecture, UX flows, and creative problem-solving beyond typical web apps.
