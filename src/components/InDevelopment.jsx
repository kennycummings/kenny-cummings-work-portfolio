      <h3>Awoken</h3>
      <h5>An original turn-based RPG built in Godot, inspired by classics like Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger.</h5>

      <p>
        <strong>Awoken</strong> is my passion projectâ€”a narrative-driven RPG where players uncover inner strength through
        turn-based combat, branching dialogue, and meaningful character progression. Built with the Godot Engine, it
        features a custom battle system, hand-drawn sprite animations, and a limit break mechanic that rewards strategy and timing.

      <p>
        I'm leading development, design, and music productionâ€”wearing multiple hats to bring this vision to life. It's a
        playground for creativity, code, and storytellingâ€”and a space where I'm constantly learning new techniques in game logic, UI/UX, and player feedback systems.
